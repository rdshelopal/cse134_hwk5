# I improved the navigation buttons by matching their style to the "Load Local" and "Load Remote" buttons, giving them rounded corners, bold text, and a consistent blue background for better clarity and interaction. Additionally, I realigned section headings (e.g., "About Me," "Projects," "Experience") to the top-left of their containers for a cleaner, more structured layout. I also removed unnecessary "Projects" and "Experience" navigation links that originally led to separate pages, since keeping everything on a single page improves accessibility and simplifies user navigation. These changes enhance visual consistency, readability, and overall user experience.
